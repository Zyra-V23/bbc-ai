PRD: Smart Contract Bug Bounty Program for Efficient Reporting and Auditing (CLI-Based)
1. Product Overview

Purpose:Develop a CLI-based bug bounty program to enhance smart contract security, allowing ethical hackers to report vulnerabilities efficiently. The program focuses on streamlined reporting, rapid auditing, and integration with IDEs for developer convenience.
Key Functionality:  
Structured vulnerability reporting through CLI commands.  
AI-assisted triaging with optional human verification.  
Transparent, severity-based reward system.



2. Technical Architecture

Platform:Command-line interface (CLI) application with LLM integration for triaging and bug analysis, optimized for IDE terminal use.  
Integrations:  
Blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum) for smart contract data.  
GitHub via MCP for repository access and context, using OAuth authentication.  
Auditing tools (e.g., Mythril, Slither) for automated bug validation.


Security:  
End-to-end encryption for report submissions and local data storage.  
Secure GitHub API interactions via MCP.



3. Core Features

Scope Definition:  
Covers specific smart contracts and bug types (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflows).  
Accessible via bug-bounty scope command.


Efficient Reporting:  
CLI command bug-bounty submit with guided prompts for:  
Steps to reproduce.  
Bug impact.  
Optional fix suggestions.


Supports proof-of-concept uploads.


Bug Auditing:  
LLM-based initial triaging of reports.  
Optional human review via --human-review flag.  
Critical bugs prioritized with --critical flag for immediate attention.


Reward Structure:  
Severity tiers (Low: $500, Medium: $2,000, High: $10,000, Critical: $50,000).  
Viewable via bug-bounty rewards.


Status Tracking:  
Real-time updates via bug-bounty status [report_id].  
IDE-compatible notifications (optional).



4. Implementation Steps

Develop CLI Application:  
Build a lightweight CLI with LLM support for triaging.


Define Scope:  
List covered contracts and bug types in CLI-accessible format.


Set Up Reporting:  
Implement secure submission process with encryption.


Enable Auditing:  
Integrate LLM and auditing tools for validation.


Configure Rewards:  
Establish severity tiers and payout mechanism.


Integrate MCP with GitHub:  
Use MCP for secure repository access via bug-bounty auth.



5. User Interaction

CLI Commands:  
bug-bounty auth: Authenticate with GitHub using OAuth.  
bug-bounty scope: Display program scope.  
bug-bounty submit: Submit a bug report with guided prompts.  
bug-bounty status [report_id]: Check report status.  
bug-bounty rewards: View reward tiers.  
bug-bounty feedback: Submit feedback on the program.


IDE Optimization:  
Commands callable from IDE terminals.  
Optional plugins for seamless integration.


Support:  
LLM provides reporting guidance within CLI.



6. Non-Functional Requirements

Efficiency:  
Audit valid reports within 48 hours.


Security:  
HTTPS for all server communications.  
Encrypted local storage of sensitive data.


Scalability:  
Support 100+ daily reports with batch processing.



7. Risks and Mitigations

Spam Reports:  
LLM filters irrelevant submissions.


Auditing Delays:  
Automate triaging and prioritize critical bugs.


Security Breaches:  
Encrypt all data and use secure GitHub authentication.



8. Success Criteria

90% of valid reports processed within 48 hours.  
50+ critical bugs resolved in the first 3 months.  
Positive participant feedback via bug-bounty feedback.
